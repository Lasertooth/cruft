# This could be better, if every lg-issue provided a list, or a detailed list,
# or it could be created by an explain script.
# Though it may not be worth the hassle, since lg-* may be removed from the
# archive (licence problems).
# For now, this filter is worth having because sarge has lg packages (and
# people will keep them around for sarge+1).
