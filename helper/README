This is a helper script to make creating filters from an existing alternatives
database automatic. It began existence by rewriting aj's shell/perl/awk
scripts.

Note that this is only meant as a quick and dirty way to initialize the filter
database. The plan is that when cruft becomes more usable, the filter files
should move to each package, and be maintained there, since a package's file
list changes over time.
