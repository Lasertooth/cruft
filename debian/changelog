cruft (0.9.6-0.8) experimental; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload blessed by aj
  * cruft:
    - do not use "/dev/stdout", rather cat to implied stdout. Also chdir to
    original directory before catting to a report file.
  * explain scripts:
    - dpkg: use find|xargs|cat|sort instead of globbing (Closes: #284711)
    - gconf: avoid warning if there are no gconf schema files

cruft (0.9.6-0.7) experimental; urgency=medium

cruft (0.9.6-0.6) experimental; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload blessed by aj
  * Rewritten the README file to clear up the general idea on how cruft works.
  * Moved common code from dash-search and filter_shell to shellexp.c
  * Added some comments to code in various files
  * Added --ignore support to cruft, and made explain files obey that (using
    functions stored in new files common.sh). This allows serious speed
    improvements in certain situations. (Closes: #29187)
  * Updated manpage (Closes: #308176)
  * Added support for running in chroots, by setting DRIVES to / if it turns
    out empty.
  * Added afs to list of ignored filesystems (Closes: #233979)
  * Use dh_installman instead of obsolete dh_installmanpages
  * Removed obsolete dh_suidregister
  * Removed junky postinst "warning" (Closes: #174877, #304440)
  * Removed the "optimization" from dash-search which caused only the first
    file containing matching pattern to be printed. Apparently the purpose of
    dash-search is to find all occurences. Noted in manpage that the file name
    is printed for each line.
  * filters/*: /usr/{doc,man} updated to /usr/share/{doc,man}
  * filters/base-files: added /srv, /media, /usr/local and its subdirs
  * filters/libc6: added /etc/.pwd.lock
  * explain/ca-certificates: new file
  * explain/dev: fixed grep to be quiet
  * explain/dpkg: use a hash to remember diversions instead of an array
  * explain/diversions: only print a diversion target if it exists in
    filesystem
  * explain/gconf: new file: a kludgy way to list at least some of the gconf files
  * explain/tmp: removed, since this was just a copy of explain/dev
  * Removed a misplaced adduser filter file.
  * Noted in changelog that previous upload Closes: #149736 (I know this is
    slight changelog abuse, but I haven't yet learned everything about BTS
    version supoprt)

cruft (0.9.6-0.5) experimental; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload blessed by aj
  * cruft:
    - Use tempfile to make temporary file, which makes -r create reportfile
      "report" (Closes: #182796, #42969)
    - Report broken symlinks themselves, rather than their inexistant
      destinations (Closes: #149736)
    - Ignore /dev/(fd|std(in|out|err)) links (Closes: #146021)
    - Added --chroots which allows to completly broken symlinks in chosen dirs
    - Do not traverse some special filesystems
      (Closes: #272124, #291820, #110000)
    - Improved command line error reporting a little (Closes: #51446)
    - Set LC_COLLATE to C to avoid sorting differences causing double output
      (Closes: #55022, #155431). This should also make sorts faster in non-C locale
      environments.
  * explain files fixes:
     - dev: don't scan it if cruft itself doesn't
     - dpkg, diversions: Treat diversions properly (Closes: #263472):
       . dpkg: don't report files which were diverted to something else
       . diversions: report diversion destinations
     - home_ftp: fixed find command (Closes: #88274)
     - init_d: fixed grep expression for new 'file' output syntax
     - lost_found: added ext3 to list of filesystems
     - users: Users are allowed not to have home dirs and mailboxes. So only
       list mailboxes and homedirs which really exist.
       (Closes: #265794, #50730) Also use /var/mail instead of deprecated
       /var/spool/mail
  * filter files:
     - prime-net: new file: (Closes: #95799)
     - debfoster: new file: (Closes: #100145)
     - more new files and additions to existing ones (Closes: #157737):
       adduser, apt, base-files, dpkg, ifupdown, krb5-config, libc6,
       libhesiod0, libnet-perl, locales, lpr, modutils, netbase,
       nfs-kernel-server, openssl, php4, popularity-contest, proftpd, tcpd
  * Wrote a manpage for dash-search (Closes: #37735)
  * dash-search: added a matched arguments cache array to speed things up just
    a little bit
  * debian/compat: set to 4
