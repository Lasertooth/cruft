cruft (0.9.7) unstable; urgency=low

  Filters and explain scripts are now only used if a package with the same
  name is present on the system. Rename your files to UPPER_CASE if you want
  them to be used every time.

  Directories /etc/cruft/filters and /usr/lib/cruft/filters are deprecated.
  Please move your custom filter files to /etc/cruft/filters-unex.

  See the README file for more information.
