  * Filters and explain scripts are now only used if a package with the same
    name is present on the system. Rename your files to UPPER_CASE if you want
    them to be used every time.

  * Directories /etc/cruft/filters and /usr/lib/cruft/filters are deprecated.
    Please move your custom filter files to /etc/cruft/filters-unex.
 
  * See the README file for more information.
